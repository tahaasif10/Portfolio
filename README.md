# ðŸ’» My First Developer Portfolio

This is the first portfolio website I ever built â€” it aint that professional, but its the best i made as a newbie! It showcases my html css and js skills, a few notable projects, and provides a brief overview of me as a developer.

## ðŸ”§ What I Used

- HTML & CSS
- Basic JavaScript  
- Simple file structure (no frameworks yet)  

I didnâ€™t use any fancy libraries or designs. Just raw code.!

---

## ðŸš€ What You'll Find

- A homepage introducing me
- Sections for skills and projects
- A contact form (basic, not connected yet)
- My very first styling efforts (aint fancy so dont expect anything ðŸ˜…)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Made This

I wanted to see what I could create from scratch. Itâ€™s not perfect, but itâ€™s **100% mine**.
